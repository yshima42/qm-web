Supporting others is admirable.  
But what if that _good deed_ is the very reason you’re burning out?

## Why Do We **Over-Give**?

### 1. **Borrowed Self-Worth**

Deep down, some of us believe _“I’m worthless unless I’m useful.”_  
A quick “thank you” hits like a tiny dose of relief—addictive, fleeting, and urging us to sacrifice even more next time.

### 2. **Fear of Abandonment & Hidden Control**

“I can’t let them dislike me or leave me.”  
That anxiety melts our boundaries.  
Ironically, a quiet need to _steer_ the other person’s behavior grows alongside our sacrifices—creating a mutual dependency.

### 3. **“Love Must Be Earned”**

If unconditional love was scarce in childhood, we may assume we must _pay_ for affection—by treating, lending money, or giving endless time.  
That’s not love; it’s a transaction.

## The Downward Spiral of Self-Sacrifice

|What You Lose|How It Hurts You|
|---|---|
|**Emotional Energy**|Chronic fatigue and self-loathing when gratitude doesn’t come back|
|**Healthy Relationships**|Bonds held together only by your giving are fragile and imbalanced|
|**Chance to Recover**|Over-helping hides the real issue and can worsen addiction|

## Rethinking **How** You Help: 4 Steps

1. **Check Your Resources**
    
    - Ask: _“Do I actually have the capacity for this?”_
        
    - If not, **saying no is an act of courage**, not cruelty.
        
2. **State Your Boundaries Out Loud**
    
    - “I can do X, but not Y.”
        
    - Clear limits make healthier relationships, not weaker ones.
        
3. **Audit Your Motives**
    
    - _“Why am I doing this?”_
        
        - Craving praise?
            
        - Afraid of rejection?
            
        - Genuinely wanting to help?
            
    - Once motives are clear, you can choose actions that truly matter.
        
4. **Borrow a Third-Party Perspective**
    
    - Talking with a therapist or addiction counselor reveals blind spots you may never see alone.
        

## Bottom Line: **Rescue Yourself First**

Self-sacrifice looks noble.  
Yet if it’s eroding your well-being, pause and reassess.

- **Value yourself first.**
    
- Then extend a hand—secure, steady, and genuine.
    

If you notice that urgent voice today saying _“I have to fix this for them!”_, stop and ask:

> **“Am I taken care of, right now?”**

When you are whole, your help becomes real help—  
and both you _and_ the people you care about can finally thrive.
