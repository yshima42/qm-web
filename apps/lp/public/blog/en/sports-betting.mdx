## 2. Why Sports Betting Hooks You

1. **In-play betting** – odds refresh every few seconds, keeping the reward circuit “always on.”
2. **Instant dopamine cycles** – near-misses and quick wins fire the same brain areas as drugs.
3. **Illusion of skill** – stats and parlays create a feeling of _control_, even when the edge is tiny.
4. **24/7 access** – one-tap deposits remove all natural stopping points.
5. **Social proof** – big-name sponsorships make betting look like normal fandom.

## 3. Five Steps to Stay Safe

### 1) Face the Numbers

Log _every_ bet—win, loss, and time spent scrolling odds. Reality kills denial.

### 2) Use Hard Blocks

- Install **Gamban** or a state self-exclusion list.
- Ask your bank to block gambling MCC codes.

### 3) Set Friction

Add a **24-hour cooling-off** on deposits and move betting money onto a prepaid card with a fixed weekly cap.

### 4) Replace the Rush

Swap live bets for something fast and social—e.g., a 15-minute HIIT session, pick-up basketball, or racing a friend on a language-learning app leaderboard.

## 5. FAQ

| **Question**                                         | **Quick Answer**                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Isn’t sports betting safer than casino games?_      | House edge may be lower, but in-play volume multiplies exposure—so losses rack up faster.                                                   |
| _I only bet $5 parlays—can that still be a problem?_ | Yes. Chasing “almost wins” is a classic escalation cycle toward bigger stakes.                                                              |
| _What if I just can’t stop?_                         | Treat it like any addiction: remove access, ask for help, and use evidence-based tools. Recovery rates exceed 60 % with structured support. |

## Bottom Line

Sports betting feels harmless—until fast odds and faster deposits trap you in a reward loop.  
Set guards, add friction, and let community replace isolation.
