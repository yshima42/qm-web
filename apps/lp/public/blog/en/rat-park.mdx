"What if addiction is caused not by the substance itself, but by **loneliness**?" Surprisingly, an experiment conducted in Canada in the 1970s reported results that support this idea. The "Rat Park" experiment used rats and drugs to investigate how **environment** and **social connections** influence addiction.

This experiment provided significant insights for our development of QuitMate. Today, from a developer's perspective, we'd like to share the story of the Rat Park experiment and our thoughts on the importance of **human connection** that emerged from it.

## Rat Paradise vs. Isolated Cage: What Was the Rat Park Experiment?

About 40 years ago, Canadian psychologist Dr. Bruce Alexander questioned the conventional wisdom that "drug addiction is caused by the drug itself."

At that time, typical animal experiments involved placing a single rat in a small cage and providing it with drug-laced water. **The isolated rat, with nothing else to do, would continuously drink the drug water.** Observing this, researchers concluded that "drugs are terrifyingly addictive."

Dr. Alexander wondered, "**Isn't that just because the rats are bored and lonely?**" So he created "Rat Park," a rat paradise about 200 times larger (8.8 square meters!) than a standard cage.

Rat Park was equipped with wheels, balls, and other toys, soft bedding materials, and many companion rats (16-20 males and females). It was essentially a theme park for rats. For comparison, traditional small, isolated cages were also used, each containing just one rat.

In both environments, the rats were given two types of water: regular water and morphine (drug) water sweetened with sugar. The rats could choose either one and drink as much as they wanted.

## "Playing with Friends" Defeated the Drug!

How did these rats in different environments behave? The results were remarkably clear.

* **The isolated rats quickly became obsessed with the morphine water** and began gulping down the sweetened drug water.
* Meanwhile, **the Rat Park rats initially tasted the morphine water but quickly switched to drinking mostly regular water.**

Even more interesting were the results when the environments were switched. Rats initially kept in isolated cages who were later moved to Rat Park suddenly stopped drinking the drug water, despite their previous addiction. Conversely, rats moved from Rat Park to isolated cages began seeking out the drug water.

**Even rats that had been in a state of "addiction" after being forced to drink only morphine water for an extended period chose regular water as soon as they were relocated to Rat Park.**

In essence, **the "environmental differences" had a more significant impact on the rats' behavior than the "appeal of the drug."** When lonely and bored, they turned to drugs, but in a fun, fulfilling environment with "connections," they had no need for drugs.

## The Importance of "Connection" for Humans

We can learn a lot from the Rat Park experiment. Of course, human addiction issues are not as simple as those of rats, but the tendency that "**loneliness and boredom deepen dependence, while connection and stimulation alleviate it**" seems to be common. In fact, loneliness and social isolation are known risk factors for alcohol and drug dependence, while support from family and friends is said to facilitate recovery.

A frequently quoted phrase in recent years is "**The opposite of addiction is connection**," stated by journalist Johann Hari in his TED talk. This message symbolizes the results of Rat Park. While the effects of drugs themselves cannot be ignored, the suggestion that what matters more is "whether the surrounding world appears to be a lonely cage or a fun paradise" resonated deeply with our development team.

We humans all seek "something" to lean on in difficult times. For some, that might be alcohol, gambling, or drugs, but what if we had **"human connections"** instead? If feelings of loneliness are eased, stress is reduced, and we realize "I don't have to bear this burden alone," we might be able to live without relying on addictive substances. Just as the Rat Park rats were so engrossed in "playing with their companions" that they forgot about the drugs, we felt that humans too could overcome addiction if they had connections to fill their loneliness.

## How Rat Park's Concept Lives in QuitMate

Our development team was greatly inspired by these experimental results and decided to make "**quitting together**" a core concept of our service, emphasizing human connections. Of course, we don't limit ourselves to drugs, nor can we provide a vast theme park in reality. However, the idea of creating an online community where people can connect casually and providing a "**place where you don't have to try hard alone**" is directly influenced by Rat Park.

QuitMate is an anonymous social network that serves as a "**safe space**" where people struggling with addiction and bad habits can easily connect. People with the same concerns gather to share daily resolutions, progress reports, complaints, and even stories of failure. When these posts receive üëç reactions and encouraging comments from others, it creates a feeling that "I'm not alone," which lightens the heart.

During the development phase, we aimed for a design that would facilitate **casual interactions** between users. For example, features like milestones make it visible that "others are working hard too!" and a UI that makes it easy to give encouragement and comments enables "small gestures of support." By doing so, we wanted to provide an experience where users can always feel the presence of others when they open the app, expanding their mental cage a little.

## In Conclusion: Let's Create "Connections" Together and Overcome Addiction

The Rat Park experiment taught us that "**people are more likely to become dependent on something when lonely, but they may overcome it with connections.**" We at QuitMate are creating a casual space for connection, an "online version of Rat Park," with this lesson in mind. Of course, reality is not as simple as an experiment, and not all problems can be solved immediately. However, we believe that escaping from "solitary loneliness" and connecting with someone, even loosely, will definitely be beneficial.

If after reading this article, you feel "that sounds interesting" or "maybe I'll take a look," please check out QuitMate. It's a place that gently accompanies you in days when you had no choice but to cling to something in your loneliness. In connections, moments are born where your heart feels a little lighter, or you think, "**I'm not alone.**" We want to nurture such a small paradise of reassurance and solidarity online. If you're willing, why not take a new step together with us, using the power of loose connections?
